"""
Classify release-asset filenames by platform and CPU architecture.

This is the single source of truth for the asset-name matching that used to live
as duplicated jq regexes in the workflow. fetch_traffic.py uses it to split
release download counts; keeping it here (with tests) means the rules can't drift
between the fetch step and anything else that needs them.

Matching mirrors the original jq patterns exactly (case-insensitive):
- Windows: 'windows', 'win-', or a .exe / .msi extension
- macOS:   'macos', 'darwin', 'osx', or a .dmg / .pkg extension
- Linux:   'linux', or a .appimage / .deb / .rpm extension
- Arch:    arm64/aarch64 -> arm64; 'universal' -> universal;
           x86_64/x64/amd64 -> x86_64; otherwise 'other'

One category comes before the operating systems:
- Homebrew: a "_homebrew" (or "-homebrew") suffix right before the extension,
  e.g. ChromIQ-macOS-arm64_v4.3.3_homebrew.dmg. ChromIQ uploads a byte copy of
  each Mac DMG under that name for its Homebrew cask, so a Homebrew install is
  counted as 'homebrew' and NOT again as 'macos'.

A name that matches nothing (demo projects, screenshots, checksums, icons) is
not an app download: it is counted as "other", apart from the app total.
