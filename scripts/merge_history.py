"""
Merge new traffic data with existing history.json file.

This script is responsible for merging newly fetched traffic data with the
existing historical data. It ensures:
- Zero-filling for missing dates
- Proper deduplication (new data takes precedence)
- Recalculation of totals
- Maintenance of the standard structured format
- Recovery from server downtime (missed workflow runs)

## Server Downtime Handling

The GitHub Traffic API provides data for the last 14 days. This means:
1. If the workflow misses a day (e.g., server down on day 1), the next run on day 2
   will still fetch day 1's data from the API
2. The merge script properly integrates this data, filling in the gaps
3. Zero-filling ensures no dates are missing in the historical record
4. Up to 14 consecutive days can be recovered without data loss

## Calendar Edge Cases

The script handles:
- Year transitions (Dec 31 -> Jan 1)
- Leap years (Feb 29)
- Month boundaries
- All date calculations use UTC timezone for consistency

Error codes: MH001-007

    Maintain a bounded per-release daily snapshot series.

    'by_release' only stores each release's *latest* cumulative download_count,

    accrued over time. This function records a dated snapshot of each young
    release's cumulative counts on every run, which is what makes reception
    ("downloads in the first 7/14 days") and decay analysis possible.

    ## Bounding

    Only releases whose age (as_of_date - published_at) is within
    RELEASE_DAILY_TRACKING_DAYS keep a daily series; older releases are dropped
    from this structure (their lifetime totals still live in 'by_release'). This

    Merge release-download snapshots and (re)compute per-day download deltas.

    ## Why this differs from clones/views

    The GitHub Releases API reports download_count as a CUMULATIVE, all-time
    counter per asset - it is not a rolling 14-day window. Each workflow run
    therefore records a snapshot of the per-platform cumulative totals, and this
    function derives per-day downloads as the difference between consecutive
    snapshots.

    ## Behavior

    - The new snapshot (today's cumulative totals) takes precedence for its date.
    - A continuous, date-sorted series is built from the first snapshot to the
      latest. Days with no snapshot carry the previous cumulative value forward
      and record a daily delta of 0 (no observed change).
    - Daily delta = max(0, cumulative_today - cumulative_previous). Negative
      deltas (e.g. a release or asset was deleted) are clamped to 0.
    - The first entry has a daily delta of 0 because there is no prior baseline.

    ## Data availability

    Lifetime totals are accurate immediately (the cumulative counter already
    reflects all-time downloads). Per-day figures only exist from the first
    snapshot onward - GitHub does not expose historical per-day download data.
