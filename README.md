# 📊 GitHub Traffic Dashboard

This dashboard tracks historical traffic data (clones, views, and release downloads) for GitHub repositories.

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-24T18:12:27.660360Z

## 📋 How Metrics Are Calculated

This dashboard uses GitHub Traffic API data to calculate the following metrics:

### 📊 Core Metrics

**Views:**
- Counted when someone visits the repository page
- Includes page views from web browsers
- Does not include visits via command-line tools or APIs

**Clones:**
- Counted when someone clones the repository
- Includes clones via `git clone`, GitHub Desktop, download ZIP, and API
- Can occur without a corresponding view event

**Release Downloads:**
- Counted when someone downloads a pre-compiled release asset (binary/installer)
- Split by platform from the asset file name (Windows, macOS, Linux); **All** is the combined total
- This is a **separate metric** from Clones - cloning the source is not a release download
- **Lifetime** totals reflect all-time downloads (GitHub's cumulative `download_count`) and are accurate immediately
- **Per-day** figures are derived by diffing daily snapshots, so they only accrue from the first tracked day onward

**Important:** Views and Clones are **independent metrics**. Users can:
- View without cloning
- Clone without viewing (e.g., via `git clone` command)
- Both view and clone

### 🔢 Calculation Formulas

**For any time period (short-term, medium-term, lifetime):**

**Total Metrics:**
- Total Views = Sum of daily views for the period
- Total Clones = Sum of daily clones for the period

**Unique Metrics:**
- Unique Views = Sum of daily unique views for the period
- Unique Clones = Sum of daily unique clones for the period
  - Note: This sums daily unique counts, which may count the same user on multiple days

**Repeat Metrics:**
- Repeat Views = Total Views - Unique Views
- Repeat Clones = Total Clones - Unique Clones
- Repeat Percentage = (Repeat / Total) × 100

**Example:**
```
If a repository has:
- Total Views: 100
- Unique Views: 20
Then:
- Repeat Views = 100 - 20 = 80
- Repeat Percentage = (80 / 100) × 100 = 80%
```

### 📈 Graph Data Aggregation

**Daily Graphs:**
- Shows raw daily data points
- Each point represents one day's activity

**Weekly Graphs:**
- Aggregates daily data into 7-day periods
- Each point represents the sum of 7 consecutive days

**Bi-Weekly Graphs:**
- Aggregates daily data into 14-day periods
- Each point represents the sum of 14 consecutive days

**Cumulative Graphs:**
- Shows running totals over time
- Each point represents the sum of all previous days plus current day
